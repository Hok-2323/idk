# FirstOnlineSchool (FOS) is an online educational community where students are invited to ask teachers and tutors for assistance in their school work, research, stress and time management. The teachers and tutors operate on a voluntary basis and are selected based on their academic profiles and subject knowledge.

# Our community goal is to make education as accessible as possible to everyone. This goal is especially important now, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic where education has been interrupted for many. 

# FOS is filled with people from across the globe, meaning that there is always someone to talk to and we are able to help everyone quickly. 

# The Discord server has over 20 easy-to-navigate channels dedicated to different subject areas. If you are unable to find the perfect channel for your question, there are general channels such as #ask-for-help and #other-subjects.

# Check out the FOS Discord server to get started!
